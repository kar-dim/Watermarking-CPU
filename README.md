This Diploma thesis aims to compare the above algorithms (mainly in execution speed) when they are implemented in GPU and CPU.
Part 1 / CPU usage for calculations. (Part 2 / GPU usage [here](https://github.com/kar-dim/diploma-thesis_GPU) )

Libraries used:
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- [CImg](https://cimg.eu/)
- [inih](https://github.com/jtilly/inih)

For building the project, the below must be installed:
- LibPNG (can be installed from Visual Studio marketplace).
